# Caveats

<br>

- using my sample PHP Lambda repos may trigger AWS charges for you

<br>

- you are responsible for all AWS charges that arise from using my sample PHP Lambda repos

<br>

- my sample PHP Lambda repos use Amazon services that are charged per use

<br>

- many Amazon services my sample PHP Lambda repos use calculates charges based on multiple parameters. Lambda is one of these services, but not necessarily the only such service 

<br>

- my sample PHP Lambda repos use Amazon services that are free tier eligible. I cannot emphasizse this enough: This does <u>not</u> mean that the Amazon services you use from using these repos will be automatically free for you

<br>

- only you know the specific situation of your specific Amazon accounts. It is up to you to understand your situation, and to understand how your use of my sample PHP Lambda repos will impact your Amazon charges. 

<br>

- Lambda functions that call other Amazon services will trigger charges for using those called Amazon services. For example, a Lambda function that sends emails via SES will trigger SES charges

Software and information in this, and in my other, sample repo:
- are for pedagogical purposes only
- may be out of date
- may contain errors and/or omissions
- may change without notice
- is not necessarily designed to run as fast as possible within Lambda
- is not necessarily designed to cause the least AWS charges
- does not optimize AWS settings to cause the least AWS charges
- does not optimize AWS security
